## Project Title

GBDA302 Week 4 Example 3: JSON Levels + Level class

---

## Authors

Karen Cochrane and David Han

## Description

This sketch demonstrates preloads and loadJSON files.

---

## Learning Goals

Learning Goals:

- preload() + loadJSON() so external data is available before setup() runs.
- How to turn raw JSON arrays into objects (instances of a Level class).
- How to switch between multiple levels by index (by pressing N on the keyboard).
- How to resize the canvas when different levels have different dimensions.

Important concept:

- "levels.json is just data"
- "Level (class) is code that knows how to interpret + draw that data"
